This is the python repository from my physics-engineer-title project.
It consists in a bundle of python files.

Directory 'tools' contains some stuff that i'm developing to handle audio data and hopefully other kinds of data in the future.
For the stuff to work you are going to have to download the directory 'data' from my google drive. How can you do that? 
Well, the easiest way is sending an email to either gerardo.mijares@lapsusdev.com or A00818999@itesm.mx. Or you can 
always hack my google drive for sure *wink wink*.
